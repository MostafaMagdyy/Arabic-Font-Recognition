!!!Feature Extraction methods suggested:
1-SIFT(Rotation Invariant) 
2-HOG - SPM
3-LBP
4-Gabor Filters
5-Combbination 
---- we can use a combination between methods but we must be carefull for the biasing the could happen 
----if we are going to use multiple methods then we need to combine them into a single feature vector 


!!!preprcessing:
Text alignment • Text color
• Text size/weight • Text rotation
• Image blur • Salt and pepper noise
• Brightness variation

we are going to use SIFT
